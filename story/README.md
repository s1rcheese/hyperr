STORY
=====

On October 3rd, I wrote some of my first lines of code. The code was for a bot named "Hyperr". When it the code worked, I was super excited and ~~spammed~~ told my mom about the bot. I started telling my friends about the bot, it later became pretty popular (7 servers is not popular). 

The topic of Hyperr changed a few times, first to a moderation bot, a werid game manger thingy for Fortnite (like that is popular), then eventually a peaceful game card bot thing.

To host the bot I kept my [potato computer (Surface Go)](http://example.com) on during the night and day. R.I.P. my parent's electrity bills. My recomenndation for something to host a Discord Bot, or something that won't be so huge, use a Rasberry PI.

I had been called "gay" (which I wasn't) for creating it. But I was admin in the guy-who-called-me-gay's Discord Server, and I later banned all everyone I could, and deleted all the bots on his Discord Server.

I orignally worked with a guy from the Arab Republic of Egypt to work on the bot, he did contributed some stuff to the bot.
